1. Composite function:
Given two functions,
$f$ and $g$, the composite functions, defined by $fog$ 
(Read as "f composed with g")

The domain of $fog$ is the set of all numbers of $g$ for which $g(x)$ is in the domain of $f$


def f(x): return x*2

def g(x): return x*4

f contains all elements of g

for given functions $f$ and $g$ find:

a) $(fog)(x)$

b) $(gof)(x)$

c) $(fofof)(x)$
