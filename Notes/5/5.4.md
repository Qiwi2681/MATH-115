Graph of a Rational Function


Ex. $$f(x) = \frac{8x^2 + 26x + 15}{2x^2 - 7x + 6}$$
where $f$ is a rational function

By Factoring
$$
\frac{(4x+3)(2x-3)}{(2x-3)(x-3)}
$$


a. Find Intercepts:

$\frac{(4x+3)(2x-3)}{(2x-3)(x-3)}= 0$

We know that any fraction is equal to zero, if its numerator is zero, therefore:

$4x + 3 = 0 , 2x-3 = 0$
$$
x = \frac{-3}{4}, 
x = \frac{3}{2}
$$
