6.2 One-to-one and inverse functions

1. One-to-one: 

    A function is one to one (1:1) if any two different inputs in the domain correspond to two different outputs

    If $x{_1} \neq x{_2}$ then $f(x{_1}) \neq f(x{_2})$

    Each input corresponds to one unique output


2. Horizontal Line Test: 

    If every horizontal line that intersects with the graph of $f$ in at most one point, then $f$ is 1:1 

    $x^3$ passes this test. $x^2$ does not, the line will pas thru twice.

    This test also determines if the graph is a function (parabola isnt)

3. Inverse Function:

    assume $f$ is 1:1

    the correspondance between the range of $f$ and the domain of $f$ is the inverse function. 
    
    denoted as $f^{-1}$

    if $(a, b)$ is a point on $f$ then, $(b, a)$ is a point on $f^{-1}$
